# SNAKE-GAME
The Snake game is a simple yet engaging arcade game. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats a food item, it grows in length. The game ends if the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.
